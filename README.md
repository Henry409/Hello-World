# Hello-World
First Repository from the tutorial
HI, My name is Henry Pellowski and at 53 years old I decided a career change to tech seems like a good idea.

I am amazed that I didn't find my way here sooner, as building software is awesome and blows my mind
everytime something works. Lol. 

Problem solving and learning new things have always held great appeal to me, and since those seem to be 
cornerstones to Software Development, it seems like it will be MUCH more fulfilling to me than working in 
a chicken processing plant. 

Wish me luck!
